## Bio
I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student working with [Prof. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at  [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/). 

Before I started the Ph.D, I was a master student of [Graph Data Management and Analysis Group]() at [Peking University](www.pku.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Jun Gao](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/Detail/?ID=1817). I am currently visiting [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/), advised by Prof. [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). My research interest lies in Data Mining, including text mining and information network analysis. I got my B.S degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2015. During my junior and senior years, I was a research assistant at [Graph Data Management and Analysis Lab](http://0-1-2-3-all.com:5000/), supervised by Prof. [Jun Gao](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/Detail/?ID=1817).

In 2015 Fall and 2016 Spring, I also worked as a teaching assistant for two courses: _Introduction to Database Systems(Honor Track)_ and _Database Systems Principles and Technologies_ instructed by Prof. [Jun Gao](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/Detail/?ID=1817).

I was born and raised in Changsha.

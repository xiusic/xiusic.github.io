## Bio
I am a final-year master student at [Peking University](www.pku.edu.cn) [Graph Data Management and Analysis Group]() at [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jun Gao](). My research interest lies in Data Mining, including text mining and information network analysis.

Before graduation, I received my B.S degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2015. During my junior and senior years, I was a research assistant at [Graph Data Management and Analysis Lab](http://0-1-2-3-all.com:5000/), supervised by Prof. [Jun Gao](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/system/zhangyan/). During the summer of 2014, I attended Machine Learning Summer School at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/), when I worked on machine learning projects with Prof. [Alex Smola]().

In 2015 Fall and 2016 Spring, I also worked as a teaching assistant for two courses: _Introduction to Database Systems(Honor Track)_ and _Database Systems Principles and Technologies_ instructed by Prof. [Jun Gao]().

I was born and raised in Changsha.

For further information, please see my [CV](CV.pdf).

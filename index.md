## Bio
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate working with [Prof. Wei Wang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at  [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/). My research interests lie in data mining, natural language processing and reinforcement learning applications, especially graph mining, question answering and sports RL.

Before I started to pursue Ph.D., I got my M.S. and B.S. from [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). During my master's, I was a member of [Graph Data Management and Analysis Group]() directed by Prof. [Jun Gao](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/teaching/inservice/search/Detail/?ID=1817). I also worked at [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/) and worked on several interesting topics in text mining, with Prof. [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).

I was born and raised in Changsha.

For further information, please see my [CV](CV.pdf).
